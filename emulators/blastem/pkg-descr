BlastEm is an open source, higly accurate emulator for the
Genesis/Megadrive that runs on modest hardware. It is the first emulator
to properly run Titan's impressive Overdrive 2 demo and it is the only
other emulator besides Genesis Plus GX that can properly run the original
Overdrive. It is the only emulator other than Exodus that passes Nemesis'
VDP FIFO Testing ROM, can display "Direct Color DMA" demos and emulates
CRAM contention (aka CRAM dots).
