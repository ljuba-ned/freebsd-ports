Create development overlays for the ports tree.

Bandar creates a temporary unionfs overlay with your development tree
on top and the upstream ports tree on the bottom, allowing you to
quickly and easily test, develop and deploy new ports. Bandar takes
advantage of the fuse-based unionfs copy-on-write feature unavailable
in the kernel variant, and provides extra security and stability by
running in userspace.

The word "bandar" is Persian for a port or haven, etymologically
meaning an enclosed area.
