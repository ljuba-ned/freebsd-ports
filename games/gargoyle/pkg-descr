Gargoyle is an Interactive Fiction (text adventure) player that
supports all the major interactive fiction formats.

Most interactive fiction is distributed as portable game files.
These portable game files come in many formats. In the past, you
used to have to download a separate player (interpreter) for
each format of IF you wanted to play. Instead, Gargoyle provides
a unified player.
